Over the years, "The HungryMind" bookstore sold their name to a dot.com and became "TheRuminator", but my philosophy hasn't changed.</FONT></H4><P><FONT FACE="Arial">For a teacher, few things surpass witnessingthe glow of enlightenment appear on a young face. It is my beliefthat we all have something to teach to one another, and also to learnfrom one another.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The name of the student bookstore when I was atMacalester College as an undergraduate was "The Hungry Mind". Ialways felt that this was a great name for a bookstore and that everycollege student should have a "Hungry Mind".</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">For many college students this is true. Thesestudents come to college with good mental appetites and are curiousand ready to learn. For these students, I like to provide the right"foods" to strengthen them for the challenges of their life&#146;swork. However, I also think that it is important to cultivate thepalate, by introducing materials that may at first seem a bit foreignor distasteful, but that upon future encounters become favoritefoods. To me, this is the essence of a well-roundededucation.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">For some students, the appetite needs to bewhetted. These students, for whatever reason, may not yet haveexperienced the joys of seeking knowledge. I think that thesestudents need to be helped to overcome their "energy of activation".For them, I like to find out who they are and what might interestthem, and then ask a lot of questions, particularly things that theymay not have thought about or encountered before.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">For students who do not want to learn, whoexpect to be taught, who will forever find seeking knowledge to bedistasteful, I have no simple solution. These students, if and whenthey are encountered, need to be dealt with one at a time. These arethe students who are most unlike those of us who have reached thislevel of academia, and who thus present the biggestchallenge.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">To <I>really</I> teach any student, however, Ifeel that it is important to reach him/her on a personal level. Icame to know several of my undergraduate professors personally vianumerous one-on-one conversations either in their offices orelsewhere on campus. From these encounters arose respect; I likedthese people. When they taught, I wanted to go to class, I paid closeattention and I learned. This level of instruction is difficult toprovide at the undergraduate level at a large research university,and the opportunity to do so is one of the reasons I find the LymanBriggs &#91;College&#93; attractive.</FONT></P><CENTER><HR><P><IMG SRC="msu.gif" WIDTH=221 HEIGHT=52 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></P><P><A HREF="index.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">back to Jim Smith HomePage</FONT></A></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">last updated October 20,2009</FONT></P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
