In general, I am happy tocomply with these requests.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">If you would like me to write aletter of recommendation for you, the first thing I ask is that youprovide me with the following things:</FONT></P><OL>   <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A CV/resume that summarizes   your academic background, work experiences, extracurricular   activities, and any honors or awards that you've received. This is   not a one-page resume to get your foot in the door somewhere;   please tell me about yourself and what you've done, and don't feel   that you need to limit this to one page. </FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A list of the courses that   you've taken (with the grades that you received) during your   college career at MSU. MSU students can access this information   easily by downloading their unofficial transcript on   STU-INFO.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A draft copy of a personal   statement that you will be submitting with your application. This   is a very important piece that tells me a lot about   you.</FONT></LI>      <LI><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The names and addresses of   the people to whom your letter should be sent, and the deadlines   indicating when the letters need to be received. Please supply any   special forms that are required for the school or program to which   you are applying, if there are any.</FONT></LI></OL><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">If you'd like to meet inperson, we can do that. Please contact me to schedule a meeting(20-30 minutes) to tell me about your future plans, goals, anddreams. After we talk, I'll have a fairly complete picture of who youare and what you are trying to do, and I'll be able to write a prettymeaningful letter for you.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Good luck with yourapplications!</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Sincerely,</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jim Smith</FONT>&nbsp;</P><P><HR></P><CENTER><IMG SRC="msu.gif" WIDTH=221 HEIGHT=52 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><P><A HREF="index.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial">back to Jim Smith HomePage</FONT></A></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial">last modified April 21,2015</FONT></P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
